# last30days

Research recent evidence across social platforms, community forums, prediction markets, and grounded web results, then merge everything into one brief.

## When to use

- Use when you need a last-30-days research brief on a person, company, product, market, tool, or trend.
- Use when you want a recent competitor comparison, launch reaction summary, creator/community sentiment scan, or shipping update.
- Use when you want structured JSON with `query_plan`, `ranked_candidates`, `clusters`, and `items_by_source`.

## When NOT to use

- Do not use for timeless encyclopedia questions with no recent evidence requirement.
- Do not use when you need only one official source and do not want social/community signals.

## Capabilities

- AISA-hosted planning, reranking, synthesis, grounded web search, X/Twitter search, YouTube search, and Polymarket search.
- Public Reddit and Hacker News retrieval with fail-soft behavior.
- Hosted discovery for TikTok, Instagram, Threads, and Pinterest when enabled in runtime config.
- Public publish bundles intentionally focus on the stateless research CLI and exclude the older watchlist / briefing / second-credential GitHub add-ons.

## Setup

- `AISA_API_KEY` is the only hosted credential used by the public skill surface.
- Python `3.12+` is required.
- Use repo-relative `scripts/` paths so the same skill layout works across compatible runtimes.
- Repo-local config can live at `./.last30days-data/config.env`, or you can pass `--api-key` directly.
