# AIsa Tavily Search

Search the web and extract page content through AIsa's Tavily API relay. This skill is suited to research, source discovery, current-events lookup, and fetching readable content from a specific URL.

## When to use

- When the user needs web search results for a topic, question, company, product, or event
- When the user wants source discovery before summarizing or comparing information
- When the user needs current-news lookup with recent-day filtering
- When the user provides a URL and wants the page content extracted for downstream analysis

## When NOT to use

- Do not use this skill for sites that require login, browser interaction, or private account access
- Do not use this skill as a direct social-posting, upload, or OAuth workflow; it performs search and URL extraction only
- Do not use this skill when there is no network access to `api.aisa.one`

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Search the web | `node scripts/search.mjs "query"` |
| Search with more results | `node scripts/search.mjs "query" -n 10` |
| Run deeper research | `node scripts/search.mjs "query" --deep` |
| Search news | `node scripts/search.mjs "query" --topic news` |
| Search recent news only | `node scripts/search.mjs "query" --topic news --days 7` |
| Extract content from a URL | `node scripts/extract.mjs "https://example.com/article"` |

## Capabilities

- Search the web through AIsa's Tavily-backed relay
- Return concise, relevant result sets for AI-agent workflows
- Run deeper research with `--deep` for broader coverage
- Focus on news search with `--topic news`

## Search

```bash
node scripts/search.mjs "query"
node scripts/search.mjs "query" -n 10
node scripts/search.mjs "query" --deep
node scripts/search.mjs "query" --topic news
```

## Options
