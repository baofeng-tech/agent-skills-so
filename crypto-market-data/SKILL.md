## Inputs and Outputs

- **Input:** coin IDs (e.g. `bitcoin`, `ethereum`, `solana`), fiat/crypto `vs_currency` codes (`usd`, `eur`, `btc`), category/exchange IDs, or on-chain platform+contract-address pairs. Use `coins list` and `exchanges id-map` to resolve user-friendly names to CoinGecko IDs.
- **Output:** JSON responses printed to stdout, matching the CoinGecko schema for each endpoint (price dictionaries, coin/exchange objects, arrays of timestamped `[ts, value]` pairs for charts, `[ts, o, h, l, c]` tuples for OHLC, ticker arrays, etc.).

## When to use / When NOT to use

**Use when:**
- You need current or historical **crypto** prices, market caps, volumes, or charts.
- You need to look up a token by its **on-chain contract address** (ethereum, binance-smart-chain, polygon-pos, etc.).
- You need **exchange-level** data — trust scores, volumes, per-pair tickers.
- You're screening across categories (DeFi, AI, L1s, etc.) or surfacing trending coins.

**Do NOT use when:**
- You need **equities or traditional finance** data — use the `marketpulse` skill.
- You need **order-book depth on prediction markets** (Polymarket, Kalshi) — use `prediction-market-data`.
- You need **on-chain wallet balances, transfers, or gas traces** — CoinGecko is a pricing/market-data source, not a node RPC.

## Requirements

- Python 3, `curl`, POSIX shell
- `AISA_API_KEY` — required, get one at [aisa.one](https://aisa.one)
