# Crypto Market Data 🪙

Query cryptocurrency market data from CoinGecko through AIsa.

Use this skill when you need current prices, historical charts, OHLC candles, token lookup by contract address, market-cap rankings, exchange data, categories, trending searches, or crypto news from a single CLI.

## Compatibility

Works with any [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io)-compatible harness, including:

- **Claude Code** and **Claude**
- **OpenAI Codex**
- **Cursor**
- **Gemini CLI**
- **OpenCode**, **Goose**, **OpenClaw**, **Hermes**
- and other tools that implement the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification)

Requires Python 3, a POSIX shell, and `AISA_API_KEY` (get one at [aisa.one](https://aisa.one)).

## What you can do

### Price tracking
```text
"What is the current price of bitcoin and ethereum in USD and EUR?"
```

### Historical charts
```text
"Get the last 30 days of BTC price data in USD"
```

### OHLC candles
```text
"Pull 7-day OHLC candles for solana"
```

### Token lookup by contract address
```text
"Find the CoinGecko price for USDC at 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 on Ethereum"
```

### Market-cap screening
```text
"List the top 25 coins by market cap with 24h change"
```

### Exchange research
```text
"What are Binance's top trading pairs by trust score?"
```

### Trend discovery
```text
"What are the top trending coin searches on CoinGecko right now?"
```

"Rank DeFi coin categories by market cap"
```

## Quick start

```bash
export AISA_API_KEY="your-key"
```

python3 scripts/coingecko_client.py simple price \
  --ids bitcoin,ethereum --vs usd,eur --include-24hr-change

  --order market_cap_desc
```

### Exchanges

# Exchanges with current trading volume and metadata
python3 scripts/coingecko_client.py exchanges list --per-page 50

# Just the ID -> name map (useful for resolving user input)
python3 scripts/coingecko_client.py exchanges id-map

# Detailed data for a specific exchange
python3 scripts/coingecko_client.py exchanges data --id binance

# Trading pairs on a specific exchange
python3 scripts/coingecko_client.py exchanges tickers \
  --id binance --order trust_score_desc
```

### News and trending

```bash
python3 scripts/coingecko_client.py news
python3 scripts/coingecko_client.py trending
```

## Inputs and outputs

- **Input:** coin IDs (for example `bitcoin`, `ethereum`, `solana`), fiat/crypto `vs_currency` codes (`usd`, `eur`, `btc`), category IDs, exchange IDs, or supported platform + contract address pairs. Use `coins list` and `exchanges id-map` to resolve user-friendly names to CoinGecko IDs.
- **Output:** JSON printed to stdout, matching the CoinGecko schema for each endpoint: price dictionaries, coin and exchange objects, arrays of timestamped `[ts, value]` pairs for charts, `[ts, o, h, l, c]` tuples for OHLC, ticker arrays, and related market-data payloads.

## When to use / When not to use

**Use when:**
- You need current or historical **crypto** prices, market caps, volumes, or charts.
- You need to look up a token by its **on-chain contract address** (`ethereum`, `binance-smart-chain`, `polygon-pos`, and similar supported platforms).
- You need **exchange-level** data such as trust scores, volumes, or per-pair tickers.
- You want to screen categories such as DeFi, AI, or L1s, or surface trending coins.

**Do not use when:**
- You need **equities or traditional finance** data — use the `marketpulse` skill.
- You need **prediction-market order-book depth** for platforms such as Polymarket or Kalshi — use `prediction-market-data`.
- You need **on-chain wallet balances, transfers, or gas traces** — CoinGecko is a pricing and market-data source, not a node RPC.

## Requirements

- Python 3, `curl`, POSIX shell
- `AISA_API_KEY` — required, get one at [aisa.one](https://aisa.one)
