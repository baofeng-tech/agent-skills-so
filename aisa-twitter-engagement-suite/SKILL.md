# AIsa Twitter Engagement Suite

Research Twitter/X profiles, tweets, and trends, then run approved posting and engagement actions through the AIsa relay.

## When to use

- The user needs Twitter/X research plus action-oriented follow-through such as posting, liking, unliking, following, or unfollowing.
- The workflow can use a Python client with `AISA_API_KEY` and network access to `api.aisa.one`.
- The task needs relay-based Twitter/X writes without asking the user to share passwords.
- The user can complete explicit OAuth approval before write actions or media posting.

## When NOT to use

- The user needs cookie extraction, password login, or a fully local Twitter client.
- The workflow must avoid relay-based network calls, remote writes, or media upload through `api.aisa.one`.
- The task needs undocumented secrets, browser-derived auth values, or hidden credential flows.
- The user only needs the broad flagship Twitter lane; use `aisa-twitter-api` for that surface.

## Quick Reference

- Required environment variable: `AISA_API_KEY`
- Required binary: `python3`
- Relay target: `api.aisa.one`
- Read client: `scripts/twitter_client.py`
- Post client: `scripts/twitter_oauth_client.py`
- Engage client: `scripts/twitter_engagement_client.py`
- References: `references/post_twitter.md`, `references/engage_twitter.md`

## Setup

```bash
export AISA_API_KEY="your-key"
```

Requirements:

- `python3`
- Internet access to `api.aisa.one`
- Explicit OAuth approval before posting or engagement writes
- Media upload support is relay-based and only applies when using approved post flows

## Common Commands

```bash
python3 scripts/twitter_client.py search --query "AI agents" --type Latest
python3 scripts/twitter_oauth_client.py authorize
python3 scripts/twitter_engagement_client.py like-latest --user "@elonmusk"
```

## Capabilities

- Research Twitter/X accounts, tweets, trends, lists, communities, and Spaces.
- Publish text, image, and video posts after explicit OAuth approval.
- Like, unlike, follow, and unfollow after authorization exists.
- Keep read and write workflows in one package while making relay and approval requirements explicit.

## Trust and Side Effects

- All networked operations go through the AIsa relay at `api.aisa.one`.
- Write actions require explicit OAuth approval before they can succeed.
- Posting with media uses relay-based upload paths supported by the runtime.
- Do not claim a post, like, follow, or unfollow succeeded until the API confirms it.
