# AIsa YouTube SERP Scout

Search YouTube videos, channels, and trends through the AIsa relay for content research, competitor tracking, and trend discovery.

## When to use

- The user wants YouTube content research, channel discovery, or trend monitoring.
- The workflow benefits from a bundled Python client for repeated searches.
- The task can use `AISA_API_KEY` instead of direct Google API credentials.

## When NOT to use

- The user needs browser automation, local scraping, or account-level YouTube actions.
- The workflow must avoid sending search requests to `api.aisa.one`.
- The request depends on files outside this package.

## Quick Reference

- Required environment variable: `AISA_API_KEY`
- Endpoint: `https://api.aisa.one/apis/v1/youtube/search`
- Python client: `scripts/youtube_client.py`

## Setup

```bash
export AISA_API_KEY="your-key"
```

## Common Commands

```bash
curl "https://api.aisa.one/apis/v1/youtube/search?engine=youtube&q=AI+agents+tutorial" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AISA_API_KEY"

python3 scripts/youtube_client.py search --query "AI agents tutorial"
python3 scripts/youtube_client.py search --query "machine learning" --country us
python3 scripts/youtube_client.py competitor --name "OpenAI" --topic "GPT tutorial"
```

## Capabilities

- Search videos, channels, and playlists with `q`
- Filter by country with `gl` and language with `hl`
- Reuse `sp` tokens for pagination or SERP narrowing
- Run competitor and top-video research from the bundled Python client

## Guardrails

- Do not ask for Google credentials or browser cookies.
- Do not claim competitor analysis succeeded before the client returns data.
- Do not assume missing locale values when the user needs a specific market.

## Security Notes

- All search requests go to `api.aisa.one`.
- Required secret: `AISA_API_KEY`.
- This package does not include browser automation, local scraping, or account actions.
